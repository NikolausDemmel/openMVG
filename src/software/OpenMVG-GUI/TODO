- Provide a finer feedback for loads (init)

- Interface to interact with sfm_data (intrinsics) 
- Interface to show matches between pairs 

- "Save as..." project 

- Check for consistency : 
  - binary features with matching parameters 
- Overwrite files already computed 

- Error feedback for workers 
  (pass params to finished signal ?) 

- Remove old computed mesh after sfm computation/colorize
